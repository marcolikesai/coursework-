##  Program Overview: MS in Quantitative Economics (Cal Poly)

The Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (MSQE) at Cal Poly is an intensive, STEM-designated program focused on building advanced skills in economic modeling, econometrics, programming, and data analysis.  
Designed to bridge theory with real-world application, the program prepares graduates for analytical roles in consulting, policy, business, finance, and further academic research.

The curriculum blends foundational economics with cutting-edge quantitative methods—including econometrics, causal inference, decision science, and machine learning—emphasizing hands-on projects using industry-standard tools (Python, R, SQL, and more).  
Throughout the program, students complete core courses, electives, and a capstone, culminating in a comprehensive exam.

Key strengths:
- **Applied focus:** All classes involve real datasets, case studies, and coding assignments.
- **Technical depth:** Emphasizes programming, statistical modeling, and computational tools.
- **Career readiness:** Designed for roles in analytics, consulting, tech, finance, and research.
